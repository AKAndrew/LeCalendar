        <h2> 1. Our project </h2>
        <p> leCalendar is a platform for those who want to be in touch with all the upcoming events, is an
            autonomous aggregator of events dedicated to a community of practice (for example, conferences on Web
            development). Specifically, the application administrator will enter a list of people and pages of interest
            whose activity on social networks will be automatically tracked. When they create or publish data about a
            new event (e.g., StagiiPeBune Ia≈üi 2019), the application will automatically process the event information
            (using the data provided by Facebook, Eventsbrite, Meetup, personal site, etc.) and centralize them on their
            own page. At least, each event will have associated date and location, a description, ticket price, and
            descriptive tags (Web Development, Social Skills, Public Speaking, ...) plus other information of interest:
            invitation only, event category (technical, advertising, recruitment). Users registered on the platform who
            will be able to "subscribe" to certain tags and receive emails about the events of interest in the next time
            period / weeks / months). The calendar of events can be exported as an iCalendar document.</p>
		<p> We, 3 promising students, wroked together in order to achieve a smooth running website that satisfies all the requests.</p>

        <h2> 2. What we used in this project </h2>
        <p>  In order to get things done we chose to use a variety of technologies that make the execution of our website possible</p>
        <h2 id="#php"> 2.1 The PHP script </h2>
        <p> Our aim was to make our application as dynamic as possible so we chose php as a way to make things communicate smoothly between themselves.</br>
		   private function _showDay($cellNumber){</br>
        if($this->currentDay==0){</br>
            $firstDayOfTheWeek = date('N',strtotime($this->currentYear.'-'.$this->currentMonth.'-01'));</br>
            if(intval($cellNumber) == intval($firstDayOfTheWeek)){</br>
                $this->currentDay=1;</br>
            }</br>
        }</br>
        if( ($this->currentDay!=0)&&($this->currentDay<=$this->daysInMonth) ){</br>
            $this->currentDate = date('Y-m-d',strtotime($this->currentYear.'-'.$this->currentMonth.'-'.($this->currentDay)));</br>
            $cellContent = $this->currentDay;</br>
            $this->currentDay++;</br>
			<strong>This is bit of code we used to make a working calendar system that can increment as many years as we want.</strong></p>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="database"> 2.2 Our database</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To be able to store our data we chose to use an intuitive database that allows us to easily go through all the information we need to use.
                Here are some bits of our database:</li>
            <li> CREATE TABLE users ( </br>
                 id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, </br>
                 username VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE, </br>
                 password VARCHAR2(200) NOT NULL, </br>
                 created_at DATE, </br>
                 updated_at DATE </br>
                 ) </br>
/ </br>
</br>
                 CREATE TABLE friends ( </br>
                 id_user1 INT NOT NULL,</br>
                 username1 varchar2(50),</br>
                 id_user2 INT NOT NULL,</br>
                 Friends varchar2(50),</br>
                 created_at DATE,</br>
                 updated_at DATE,</br>
                 CONSTRAINT fk_friends_id_user1 FOREIGN KEY (id_user1) REFERENCES users(id),</br>
                 CONSTRAINT fk_friends_id_user2 FOREIGN KEY (id_user2) REFERENCES users(id),</br>
                 CONSTRAINT no_duplicates_friends UNIQUE (id_user1, id_user2)</br>
                 )</br>
/</li>
            <li> As you can se we carefully chose our constraints and datatypes to avoid having invalid entries in our tables. </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="website">
        <h2> 3. How it works?</h2>
        <p> By making connexions to our database, the website takes whatever information it needs from the tables of refference.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Here is how we thought when building the application. </strong></p>

        <h2 id="addevent"> 3.1 Add event </h2>
        <p> In order to store the events we want to use we made it possible to complete a form with the desired data and insert the data in our database </p>
        <p> To do that we use an insert command that binds certain variables received from the user for protection.</br>
		    $query = "BEGIN lecalendar_external.add_event(:a_titlu,:a_descriere,:a_locatie,:a_current_date,:a_current_date,:a_start_hour,:a_end_hour,:a_visible,:a_creator,:a_tags); END;";
             </p>
        <p> Complete the form with the details and when you are done press the button <em><strong> Add event </strong></em>.</p>
		<h2 id="addfriend"> 3.2 Add a friend </h2>
        <p> Similar to creating an event, friend adding means that we insert the data we want in the "friends" table so we can use it afterwards to view our friends.</p>
        <p> $query="insert into friends values (:cid,:cuser,:fid,:fuser,null,null)";</p>
		<h2 id="Friendlist"> 3.3 See your friends </h2>
        <p> After inserting a friendship relation in our table we can view all the friends we have </p>      
        <p>      $query="select Friends from friends where id_user1=:cid"; </p>		
		<h2 id="sendmsg"> 3.4 Send a message </h2>
        <p> With another form we can select a user that we are friends with and insert a text that our friend will receive.</p>
        <p> $query = "SELECT id from users where username=:a_username";</br>
            $c = oci_connect("STUDENT", "STUDENT", "");</br>
			while (($row = oci_fetch_array($s, OCI_ASSOC+OCI_RETURN_NULLS)) != false) { </br>
                echo "<tr>\n"; </br>
    foreach ($row as $item) { </br>
        echo "<td>"; </br>
        echo $item!==null?htmlspecialchars($item, ENT_QUOTES|ENT_SUBSTITUTE):"&nbsp;"; </br>
        echo "</td>\n"; </br>
    }</br>
    echo "</tr>\n";</br>
}</br>
echo "</table>\n";</p>		</br>
		<h2 id="viewmsg"> 3.5 View your messages </h2>
        <p> To be able to view a message we interact with our database in such a way that we choose all the messages a receiver has.</p>
        <p>  $query="select sender_name,text from messages where receiver=:a_creator";</p>		
    </section>

    <section id="progress">
	<p> Our project has evolved without a break throughout the course of the whole semester.</br>
	    Every lesson we had in our Web Technologies class we got closer and closer to achieving a realistic website.</br>
		In the beggining we only had a schematic website desing that only used html and css tech. That allowed us to have a base for our website that </br>
		was further going to evolve into something dynamic that can interact with many things.</br>
		After studying the first few PHP lessons, we began building it so it could start communicating with an intuitive database.</br>
		Furthermore we started being able to use functions that could manipulate data from the database only by completing some form of data insertion in the website.</br>
		Finally after having done many functions and procedures, we started securing the data we have by not allowing SQL or HTML injections of any kind and protecting our user's sessions.</br>
