        <h2> 1. Intro </h2>
        <p> leCalendar is a platform for those who want to be in touch with all the upcoming events, is an
            autonomous aggregator of events dedicated to a community of practice (for example, conferences on Web
            development). Specifically, the application administrator will enter a list of people and pages of interest
            whose activity on social networks will be automatically tracked. When they create or publish data about a
            new event (e.g., StagiiPeBune Iaşi 2019), the application will automatically process the event information
            (using the data provided by Facebook, Eventsbrite, Meetup, personal site, etc.) and centralize them on their
            own page. At least, each event will have associated date and location, a description, ticket price, and
            descriptive tags (Web Development, Social Skills, Public Speaking, ...) plus other information of interest:
            invitation only, event category (technical, advertising, recruitment). Users registered on the platform who
            will be able to "subscribe" to certain tags and receive emails about the events of interest in the next time
            period / weeks / months). The calendar of events can be exported as an iCalendar document.</p>
